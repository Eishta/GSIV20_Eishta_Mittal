This Project is a Movie Browser App:

### INSTRUCTIONS ON RUNNING THE CODE
1. Clone the project from the repositor :
 ## https://github.com/Eishta/GSIV20_Eishta_Mittal.git

2. run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies with the correct versions.

3. run 'npm start' to run the app at 'http://localhost:3000'

### CODE STRUCTURE

The project is based on the basic rule of React - components  and reusability
I have tried to create components based on their functionality so that they can be reused wherever required.

The Details page required a more profiecient way to work as it needs routing , data transfer , Header Component reusability , and navigating back to the home page. 

Overall it was a good assignment and helped me learn new ways.

### Given More 4 hours

If given 4 hrs more , I would like to add more features to the app from the api.
